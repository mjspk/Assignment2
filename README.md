# Assignment 2 Readme

## Goal
To develop a Deep Learning PyTorch-based tutorial that solves an interesting deep learning problem using techniques and complexity relevant to our ENSF645 course.

## Objective
To build a python/PyTorch tutorial focused on pre-processing sound data to make it ready for use in training a CNN classifier model.

## Primary Libraries and Frameworks
* PyTorch
* Librosa
* Scikit-learn

## Tutorial Areas of Focus and Highlights
* Experimented with a new/unfamiliar domain (audio) and tools (e.g., Librosa library).
* Employed randomized data augmentation to expand and balance our input data.
* Used visualizations and audio clips to better understand the input data, augmentations, and results.
* Use of class and functions to group and encapsulate various functionalities (e.g., AudioLoader, DataBalancer, AudioModel, and Early Stopper classes).
* Extracted features using established techniques (e.g., Zero-Crossing Rate, Root Mean Squared Error, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).
* Harnessed the power of a teammateâ€™s home-based GPU mini-farm.
* Analysed model performance during training, validation, and testing.
* Use of comments, output/print statements, and a widget progress meter to improve user experience.

## Main Challenges / Learnings
* Learned about audio data, processing, feature extraction, and modeling.
* Increased our experience and understanding with building a PyTorch audio model pipeline/workflow.
* Main challenge was model training and validation time.
* Another challenge was concurrent/parallel work using Jupyter Notebooks.
